# QTicTacToe

A Quantum Version of the classic TicTacToe Game. This game was originally created for the Quantum Coalition Hackathon 2022, and later improved as a personal project. We are still working on a UI, so currently you can only play the game on Jupyter Notebook Consoles.

## General Rules:

1. Instead of placing normal crosses and noughts, you will be placing superpositions of crosses and noughts called Qubits.
2. The 3x3 Grid is numbered from 0-8 (Top-Left to Bottom-Right, row-wise)
3. You and the Computer take turns placing your Qubits (You can only choose to place from a pre-defined set of Qubits)
4. You and the Computer can both choose to "Measure" any 3 Qubits along a row, a column or a diagonal. By Measuring, you force the Qubits to collapse onto either a cross or a nought, in accordance to the probabilities of the Qubit. The goal is to measure and find **either** three crosses **or** three nuts.
5. You and the Computer can both choose to measure a maximum of 5 times. If a measurement is successful, you win, otherwise the 3 Qubits you measured are removed from the grid, and the game continues. 
6. If you (or the computer) make 5 unsuccessful Measurements, you lose!

## Quantum Edge:

As it stands right now, this a game of odds, and in order to make it strategic, we added the following Quantum advantages for the user:

1. The user has an option to Entangle Qubits. Entanglement means that the user can guarantee two Qubits at a given time would either both have the same result or the opposite result (as per the user's choice). For example, if you have a Qubit 75/25 on Grid Square 3, and you choose to place a **positively Entangled** Qubit on Grid 7, the computer is simply going to interpret it as a 75/25 Qubit (It cannot see Entanglement, it's your secret Superpower!) Therefore, statistically the computer still believes there is a 0.75x0.25x2 chance they might be opposite, and would factor those into its calculations. However, when actually measured, there is A 75% chance you will measure both positive, or a 25% chance you would measure both negative. Use this to your advantage by strategically placing Entangled Qubits! **Note However**, if you ever measure the source Qubit without measuring the Entangled one, it would still be removed from the Grid. You cannot have an Entangled Qubit on the Grid when the source has been removed. 

2. You, also have the ability to Super Measure! Basically, you can measure all existing Qubits on the Grid, and if anywhere you manage to measure three same in a row, you win! However, be cautious, Super Measure is a gamble, and if you fail, you lose instantly!
 
## How To Play:

Download the Jupyter Notebook File. Run all the cells Except the Top One! Run the Top Cell last, and Enjoy!

#Run this once at the beggining only on your console
pip install opencv-python 

**EDIT:** Version 1 plays on the console. Version 2 has updated graphics for the board.
